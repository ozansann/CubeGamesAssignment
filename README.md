Cube Games Assignment
This prototype was made for Cubes Games. In the game, the user can send the ball to the desired point with the projectile motion method. The user creates the ball at the point 
he/she clicks first, and then sends the ball to the point he clicks on the second click. The maximum height and speed variables that the ball can rise can be changed via the 
user interface. In addition, the colors of the ground and balls can be changed via the user interface. The camera can be moved with the WASD keys and the camera rotation can be 
changed with the middle mouse button.
